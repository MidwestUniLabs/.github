# Midwest UniLabs

Midwest UniLabs is focused on creating affordable, modular lab hardware and software for universities and research institutions. Our goal is to make it easier to build, run, and manage experiments without the high cost of traditional systems.

## What We Do

* Develop embedded systems for research and teaching
* Build connected devices for behavioral testing and automation
* Design web interfaces and servers for managing trials and collecting data
* Create scalable, modular hardware platforms for lab use

## Projects

This GitHub organization hosts our software, hardware, and documentation, including:

* Device firmware and control systems
* Central server and database backends
* Data visualization tools
* PCB designs and hardware documentation

## Current Focus

Our first major product is a behavioral testing system based on the Skinner Box concept. It includes:

* Individual devices running Python-based control software
* A central server with a database and user interface
* Simple tools for deployment, monitoring, and data collection
